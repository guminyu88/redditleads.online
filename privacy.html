    <h1>Privacy Policy for OppRadar</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>OppRadar ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome Extension.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect personal identification information (PII) such as names, emails, or phone numbers, unless you voluntarily provide them for payment processing (handled by third-party processors).</p>
    <p><strong>Reddit Data:</strong> The extension processes Reddit posts directly on your device. We do not store Reddit posts on our servers. Analysis is performed either locally or via the AI provider you configure.</p>
    <p><strong>API Keys:</strong> If you provide your own API Key (e.g., OpenAI), it is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API (`chrome.storage`). It is never sent to our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>We use the data solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scan Reddit for posts matching your keywords.</li>
        <li>Analyze posts using AI (if enabled) to determine relevance and sentiment.</li>
        <li>Display results within the extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>AI Providers:</strong> If you use the AI features, post content is sent to the configured provider (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek) for analysis. Please refer to their respective privacy policies.</p>
    <p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payments are processed by ExtensionPay / Stripe. We do not process or store your financial information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All scanned data and settings are stored locally in your browser. You can clear this data at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing the extension's storage.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of the extension signifies your acceptance of any changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.</p>
